## ***2020-10-13 individual meeting***
- ***Work Report about ROS, SLAM, etc.***
  1. **Work-Ros:**
    - Tutorial_Beginning level (21 parts)
    - Create ROS workspace 
    - Create topics(publishers subscribers) 
    - Create services(clients, servers)
    - TF… 
  2. **Slam:** 
  - 3D Rigid body Pose (transform matrix, rotation vector, euler angle, quaternion)
  - Lie groupand Lie algebra for the pose optimization
  - Point cloud modeling (OpenCV, Sopus, Pangolin)
  - Current phase: non-linear optimization
  - Next: Visual odometer, front-end & back-end design, loopback detection, mapping
  3. **Others:**
    - Paper reading Kevin’s (AR/VR)
    - Deeping learning course: 3(/5) classes 
    - Virtual engine: Installed AirSim into UE4 in both linux and windows, can be controlled by the algorithm.
    - Others: Mathematics(linear algebra, probability theory)/Programming(C++), Linux operations…
  4. **Next Step:**
    - Enrollment
    - Cooperate with Henry, before the ISARC meeting. (28 Oct) 
    - Increase paper reading, think about how to reproduce.
    - Further ROS studies, try to realize a more advanced project. Learn some about Gazebo, Rivz.
    - Finish SLAM classes, realize the optimization, how to combine with ROS.
    - Finish deep learning courses. (2/5) 
    
## ***2020-09-28 individual meeting***
- ***VR,AR & Robot in Construction Industry***
