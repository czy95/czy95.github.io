This site aims to collect all the hard work to uncover the essential idea of an
research paper, to reduce the obstacle in testifying the existed result.

Meanwhile, To Collect opinions given by predecessor as many as possible.

I figured out the mission of this site, it isn't a place for posting study report which can be listed in isolated documents, instead, every post here will be about the idea in expertise I recently come up with. All is for practicing my creativity, I want to do something which has eternal meaning, challengeable and won't fade away with time. Even my code style align with the great programmer.I choose not to consider myself as a programmer, I will be a physicist, a thinker.

From [https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python](https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python)
>  I do not consider myself a programmer; I create these little programs as experiments to play with the language, or to solve problems for myself. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.

In [Hogg's research](http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/), he made the rules,
> 1. I must post five days per week (I choose which five), except when on vacation, no matter what I have done.
> 2. I must write only about research; no committees, no refereeing, no teaching, no excuses.

[Yi Wang](http://phyw.people.ust.hk)
>  And as a physicist instead of an applied mathematician, you should indeed learn the motivation and the grand picture by reading and thinking. You will be sooner or later independent and your ideas and depth of thinking will then be the key difference between you and your peers with comparable technical strength.

Since not so much raw idea to write down. Post contents also include figure out concepts via google, I just changed my traditional way of learning physics, stopping rely on mono-resource.  Try to learn by teaching and think out an easy way to explain a thing.

As I haven't dived in Theoretical Physics for a real long time, to recover my cognition on physics, I got to form an overview of my knowledge database and pull my self together, then take a deep breathe and hit on the road. Now the post is mainly to iron out
the main body and stretch out to the unfamiliar but important topic.

How about setting the ratio of recording raw ideas and distinguishing fuzzy concepts as 1 to 3?
